These metrics can be accessed through the `obs` attribute of the dataset.\n\nNext, we normalize the data using the `normalize_total` function, which scales the counts of each cell so that they sum up to a target sum (in this case, 1e4).\n\nFinally, we perform logarithmic scaling of the normalized data using the `log1p` function, which applies a natural logarithm transformation (log1p) to the data to reduce the differences between high and low expression values.

This step is important for many downstream analysis techniques as it removes the impact of gene expression differences that are mainly driven by total expression level rather than biological variation.\n\nNext, we use the `pca` function to perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the scaled data. PCA is a commonly used dimensionality reduction technique that aims to capture the major sources of variation in the dataset by transforming the data into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The resulting principal components can be accessed through the `obsm` (observations matrix) attribute of the dataset.\n\nNote that we don't need to explicitly save the PCA results as a file as specified in the task.
